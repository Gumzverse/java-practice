# Java Practice

*This repository contains my Java practice projects and exercises as I continue learning and refining my skills in the language.*

I’ve already completed some Java projects at school before creating this GitHub repository, so I’ll be skipping some of the very basic exercises.

Below is the roadmap I’m following for my Java learning journey. You can also check it out here: [Java Roadmap PDF](https://roadmap.sh/pdfs/roadmaps/java.pdf)
